# 🚀 Anirudh's Portfolio (Now with 100% More Pixels)

Welcome to the digital manifestation of my consciousness. If you're reading this, you've either stumbled here by accident or you're a recruiter (hi! please hire me).

## 🕵️‍♂️ What is this?

This is a **React + Vite** powered portfolio that proves I can center a `div` and much more. It's designed to be interactive, responsive, and slightly over-engineered because "simple" is just a nice word for "boring".

## ✨ Features (The Cool Stuff)

- **💻 Terminal Intro**: Because first impressions matter, and nothing says "I code" like a green blinking cursor on a black screen.
- **⌘ Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + K`)**: For power users who refuse to touch their mouse. Navigate the site like a pro.
- **🖱️ Custom Cursor**: A magnetic cursor that follows you obediently. It respects your personal space (mostly).
- **🔥 GitHub Heatmap**: Live proof that I touch grass occasionally, but mostly keyboards.
- **🎨 Interactive UI**: Buttons that glow, cards that tilt, and sections that slide in smoothly thanks to **Framer Motion**.
- **☕ Caffeine Widget**: A subtle button to fuel my coding addiction. (Please, I need it).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Spells Used

- **React**: The library that makes me feel powerful.
- **Vite**: Because waiting for Webpack is so 2020.
- **Tailwind CSS**: styling = "speed".
- **Framer Motion**: animating everything because static sites are sad.
- **Lucide React**: Icons that are sharper than my wit.

## 🥚 Easter Eggs

There might be some hidden secrets. 
- Open the browser console (F12).
- Try typing `do a barrel roll` in the terminal intro (if you're fast enough).
- Click the period in the Navbar logo. Don't ask why.
